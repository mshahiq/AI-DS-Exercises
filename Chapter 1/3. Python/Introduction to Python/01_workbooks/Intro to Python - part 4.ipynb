This means that the app needs to check if a certain variable `battery_level` is lower than the value 5, i.e., if the comparison `battery_level < 5` evaluates to `True`.

    "\r\n",
    "**Side note**: In many programming languages (actually, in almost all programming languages), code blocks are recognized by having them start and end with a specific symbol or keyword. For instance, in languages such as Java and C++, code blocks are enclosed by curly brackets, while in languages such as Pascal and Modula, code blocks are started with the keyword `begin` and ended with the keyword `end`. That means that in almost all languages, indenting to recognize code blocks is not necessary. However, you will find that code written by capable programmers is always nicely indented, regardless of the language. This makes it easy to see which code belongs together, for instance, which commands belong to an `if` statement. Python makes indenting a requirement. While for experienced programmers who are new to Python this seems strange at first, they quickly find that they do not care -- they were indenting nicely anyway, and Python's strategy makes that beginning programmers are also required to write nice-looking code.\r\n",

Most editors (including the editor in these notebooks) will auto-indent for you, i.e., if, for instance, you write the first line of an `if` statement, once you press *Enter* to go to the next line, it will automatically \"jump in\" one level of indentation (if it does not, it is very likely that you forgot the colon at the end of the conditional expression). Also, when you have indented one line to a certain level of indentation, the next line will use the same level. You can get rid of indentations using the *Backspace* key.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For Python programs, a normal level of indentation is four spaces, i.e., one press of the *Tab* key should \"jump in\" four spaces. As long as you are in one editor, you can in such a case either use the *Tab* key, or press the spacebar four times, to go up one indentation level. So far so good. You may get into problems, however, if you port your code to another editor, which might have a different setting for the *Tab* key. If you edit your code in a such a different editor, even though it might look okay, Python may see that there are indentation conflicts (a mix of tabulations and space-indentations) and may report a syntax error when you try to run your code. Most editors therefore offer the option to automatically replace tabulations with spaces, so that such problems do not arise. If you use a text editor to write Python code, check if it contains such an option, and if so, ensure that tabulations are set to 4 and are automatically replaced by spaces."
