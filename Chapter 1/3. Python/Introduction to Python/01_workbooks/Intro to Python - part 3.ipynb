    "\n",
    "Here is the crux: `print()` has *no* return value, so there is nothing that Python can use for `<something>`. For situations such as this, Python has a special value called `None`. So the first `print()` gets called with `None` as argument, and this leads to Python displaying the word \"None\". \n",

    "`None` is a special value that indicates \"no value at all\". If you try to print such a value, Python prints the word `None`, but is not actually printing a string that is \"None\". It only indicates that there was nothing to print. `None` is different from, for instance, an empty string (`\"\"`). An empty string is still a value, namely a string of length zero. `None` is no string at all, no integer, no float, nothing.
